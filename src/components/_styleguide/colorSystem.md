## Color Palette

The color system consist of named colors like, gray, blue, green combined with a value for the shade of the color. Shades are created in steps of hundreds from 800 down to 100.

In general, ui-elements with the same purpose should use the same shades for their respective parts. For example an inline notification for a warning might have the border-color yellow-700 while a similar inline notification for success messages might have a border-color of green-700.
